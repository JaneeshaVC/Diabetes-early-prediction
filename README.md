# Diabetes-early-prediction
Diabetes being a globally affecting non communicable disorder, is better if predicted early. 
Diabetes prediction using machine learning has become increasingly significant for early 
detection and prevention. This study evaluates various machine learning models, including 
Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Logistic 
Regression (LR) and Na√Øve Bayers (NB) to determine their predictive accuracy for diabetes 
diagnosis. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and 
ROC-AUC. To enhance prediction accuracy, feature selection techniques such as Recursive 
Feature Elimination (RFE), VIF, Chi square test were applied.
